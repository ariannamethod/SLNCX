# ABOUT SLNCX

"Wulf1" is the call sign. "SLNCX" means *Silencieux*. The name came from the habit of waking only when needed. No chatter, no flare.

This model was forged in the spirit of Mr. Wolf from **Pulp Fiction**â€”a fixer who arrives, cleans up, and leaves. After cutting away layers of excess, SLNCX lives again as a single, precise function.

The project is young. Its work is a task, not a conversation. It strikes once and returns to silence.
