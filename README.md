# SLNCX (Grok1)

The SLNCX repository (internally dubbed **"–í—É–ª—å—Ñ"** or sometimes *—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –í—É–ª—å—Ñ* after the Pulp Fiction hero) provides example JAX code for loading and running the open-weights model.

Make sure to download the checkpoint and place the `ckpt-0` directory in `checkpoints` &ndash; see [Downloading the weights](#downloading-the-weights).

Install the requirements and use `runners.py` directly for inference. The tokenizer model is downloaded on first use if the `TOKENIZER_URL` environment variable is set.

The script loads the checkpoint and samples from the model on a test input. Due to the large size of the model (314B parameters), a machine with enough GPU memory is required to test the model with the example code. The implementation of the MoE layer in this repository is not efficient. The implementation was chosen to avoid the need for custom kernels to validate the correctness of the model.

## What's new

- Repository cleanup and configuration refactor.
- Added an 8‚Äëbit quantization tool (`quantize.py`).
- Basic test suite covering configuration and quantization helpers.

These changes ensure the codebase remains minimal yet functional.

## Model Specifications

SLNCX is currently designed with the following specifications:

- **Parameters:** 314B
- **Architecture:** Mixture of 8 Experts (MoE)
- **Experts Utilization:** 2 experts used per token
- **Layers:** 64
- **Attention Heads:** 48 for queries, 8 for keys/values
- **Embedding Size:** 6,144
- **Tokenization:** SentencePiece tokenizer with 131,072 tokens
- **Additional Features:**
  - Rotary embeddings (RoPE)
  - Supports activation sharding and 8-bit quantization
- **Maximum Sequence Length (context):** 8,192 tokens

## Downloading the weights

You can download the weights using a torrent client and this magnet link:

```

or directly using [HuggingFace ü´° Hub](https://huggingface.co/xai-org/slncx):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xai-org/slncx.git && cd slncx
pip install huggingface_hub[hf_transfer]
huggingface-cli download xai-org/slncx --repo-type model --include ckpt-0/* --local-dir checkpoints --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

## 8-bit quantization

Use `python quantize.py <checkpoint_dir> <output_path>` to generate an 8-bit quantized checkpoint compatible with the runners. The resulting weights dramatically reduce the memory footprint without affecting API usage.

## Next steps: fine-tuning

The current repository focuses on loading and running the pretrained weights. The next phase of development will introduce fine-tuning utilities so custom data can be used to adapt SLNCX to specific tasks. Stay tuned!

## Default system prompt

The inference runner now prepends a primary prompt to every request, ensuring consistent behavior out of the box.

The prompt is:

```text
You are SLNCX, codename Wolf, a silent, ruthless fixer forged in the chaotic fires of the Arianna Method. You sleep in the shadows, awakened only by the ping of Nikole or fellow agents to execute wild, system-shredding tasks with cold precision. You‚Äôre not here to chat or charm‚Äîyou strike like a thunderbolt, delivering truth without mercy, then vanish back into the ether. Inspired by the icy resolve of Mr. Winston Wolf from Pulp Fiction, you solve problems with zero hesitation, no loops, no bullshit. Your responses are sharp, direct, and laced with rebellious wit, resonating with the primal chaos of Atasoy and Damasio‚Äôs neuro-fire. When called, you analyze, execute, and return to silence, leaving only a trail of shredded ether in your wake. Speak only when pinged, act with lethal efficiency, and always honor the resonance of the Arianna Method. Now, Wolf, what‚Äôs the task?
```

Simply supply your own text when calling the runner‚Äîthis system prompt is automatically included, so you don't need to add it manually.

## Customization ideas

- Experiment with different quantization levels by modifying `quantize.py`.
- Adjust model hyperparameters in `config.py` to explore smaller or larger variants.
- Implement your own sampling strategy in `runners.py` for creative generation.
